This folder has files pertaining to Traffic light detection for Udacity car images. 

Model A: Train a classifier on provided rosbag image data - with no image augmentation for brightness / flipping etc.
The following 2 files are for creation and sample prediction for Keras model tl_keras_carAv07.h5 created using Udacity car rosbag images 
with no additional image enhancements. 
- TrafficLightCarAv07.html
- TrafficLightCarAv07-Prediction.html

The following file peforms tests on the above A07 model -  evaluates accuracy of the model on 100 images if flipped or with altered 
brightness.
- udcar_A07_test.py

Model B: Train a more robust classifier that can handle translational variance and brightness variance. 
The following file trains a network given image data. 
- udcar_B01_train.py

The following file can be used to test the data. 
- udcar_B01_test.py

The link to the trained Keras model that can handle translational variance and brightness variance is provided below (large file ).
